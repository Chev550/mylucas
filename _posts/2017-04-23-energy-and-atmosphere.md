#### Building loads

> Understanding the systems that consume energy in a building helps project teams focus on those systems that can have the most impact.

__What is process energy?__

__What systems consume the most energy in a building?__

Lighting is often the largest contributor to a buildingâ€™s energy use, so lighting design and control are critical to reducing energy consumption.

#### Energy efficiency

> After reducing energy demand, energy efficiency should be promoted to use less energy while doing the same amount of work.

__What is the difference between reducing energy demand and increasing energy efficiency?__

__What role does commissioning have in a building?__

__What is the payback period for commissioning?__

#### Alternative and renewable energy practices

> This exam object covers the different types of renewable energy and energy reduction.

__What is a REC?__

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) represent the environmental attributes of electricity produced from renewable energy sources sold separately from commodity electricity.

The REC does not mean you purchase that hour of power, but the REC is purchasing the benefits from the renewable energy that has been created. RECs have no geographic constraints, because they are sold separately from electricity.

__Who certifies green power?__

__Who triggers a demand response event?__

__What are carbon offsets measured in?__

A carbon offset is a unit of carbon dioxide equivalent that is reduced, avoided, or sequestered to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Carbon offsets are quantified and sold in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e).

#### Environmental concerns

> This exam objective focuses on chemicals that cause ozone depletion and global warming and how the use of these chemicals can be reduced or eliminated.

__What are halons?__

Halons are used as fire extinguishing agents, both in built-in systems and in handheld portable fire extinguishers. Halon production in the U.S. ended on December 31, 1993, because they contribute to ozone depletion.

__What are CFCs?__

CFCs: chlorofluorocarbons

HCFCs: hydrochlorofluorocarbons

__What does ozone protect?__

Good ozone occurs naturally in the stratosphere approximately 10 to 30 miles above the earth's surface and forms a layer that protects life on earth from the sun's harmful rays. The less ozone the Earth has, the less protection we get from ultraviolet (UV) rays. Increased UV can reduce crop yield and disrupt the marine food chain. For humans, increased UV can lead to the development of cataracts and skin cancer.
